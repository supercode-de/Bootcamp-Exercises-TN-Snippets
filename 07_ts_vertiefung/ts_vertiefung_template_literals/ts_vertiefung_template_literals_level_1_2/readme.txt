// Foo Fighters - Best of You



I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holding you
Were you born to resist or be abused?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Are you gone and on to someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
Your trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Oh
Oh, ho-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
The life, the love you'd die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts
Your trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
I've got another confession, my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new
Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in, I refuse
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Has someone taken your faith
It's real, the pain you feel
Your trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Oh
