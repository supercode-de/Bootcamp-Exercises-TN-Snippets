<h1>JavaScript</h1>
<article>
  	JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
  	conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often
  	just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax,
  	dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
  	functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core
  	technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web
  	pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of
  	websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers
  	have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. As a multi-paradigm
  	language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative
  	programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
  	working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
  	and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not
  	include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
  	facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those
  	APIs. JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but
  	they are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node.js. They are also
  	embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as
  	Electron and Cordova. Although there are similarities between JavaScript
  	and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard
  	libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
