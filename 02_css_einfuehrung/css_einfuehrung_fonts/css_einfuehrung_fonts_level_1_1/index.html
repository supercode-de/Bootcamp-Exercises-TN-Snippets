        I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for
        this sort of thing. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I can't get
        involved! I've got work to do!
    </p>
    <p>
        You don't believe in the Force, do you? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.
        Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you,
        Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? He is here. I
        suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self
        and act on instinct. What?!
    </p>

        Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Don't act so surprised,
        Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several
        transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.
