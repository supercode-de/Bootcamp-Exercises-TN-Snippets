    <h1>Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems.</h1>
    <h2>What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? Oh, so they have Internet on computers now!
        "Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls,
        just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.</h2>
    <p><strong>I hope I didn't brain my damage.</strong> <em> Old people don't need companionship.</em> They need to be
        isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal
        use.</p>

        <p>How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain
            Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies?
            For
            fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound
            effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. The Internet King? I wonder if he could
            provide
            faster nudity…</p>

        <li>Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the
            bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*</li>
        <li>Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs.</li>

    <h5>I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children. Attempted murder? Now
        honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? Your guilty consciences may make you
        vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and
        rule you like a king!</h5>

        <li>Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to
            go to the bathroom.</li>
        <li>Donuts. Is there anything they can't do?</li>
        <li>"Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these
