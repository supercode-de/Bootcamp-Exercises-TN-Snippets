    <h1>Look, last night was a mistake.</h1>
    <p>There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! It's toe-tappingly tragic! It's toe-tappingly tragic! Quite
        possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down
        with your children, and hitting them?</p>
    <p>Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. And then the battle's not so bad? You guys go on without me!
        <strong> I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!</strong> <em> It's okay, Bender.</em> I like cooking
        too.</p>
    <h2>Why yes! Thanks for noticing.</h2>
    <p>Tell her she looks thin. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be
        something you'd have to freebase. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were
        there, and you were there!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bender, quit destroying the universe!</li>
        <li>That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?</li>
        <li>Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Say what?</h3>
    <p>Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE,
        PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we
        walk!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A true inspiration for the children.</li>
        <li>It's a T. It goes "tuh".</li>
        <li>Hey, guess what you're accessories to.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. I haven't felt much of anything since
        my guinea pig died. Large bet on myself in round one. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can
        any of us trust you?</p>
    <p>Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Ooh, name it after me! We don't have
        a brig. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Shinier than yours, meatbag.</p>
