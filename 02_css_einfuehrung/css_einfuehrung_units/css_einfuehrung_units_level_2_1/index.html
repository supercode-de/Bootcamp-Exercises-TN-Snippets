  <h1>Pet Names</h1>
  <p>
    Plenty of my friends have developed nicknames with their romantic
    partners. I asked the question on Facebook and got a broad assortment of
    answers: There’s a husband and wife called “Nerk(le) and (Milk)Dud,” a
    dating couple called “Sweefy and Darsh,” and former boyfriends who knew
    each other as “Tiger and Teddy.” An American man who dated a Chinese woman
    told me he called her “Popo,”,which means “wife” or “broken broken,”
    depending on your intonation – and she called him “Benben,” which he says
    means something like “dumb dumb,” referring to his lackluster mastery of
    the Chinese language at the time.
